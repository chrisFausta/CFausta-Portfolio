        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My journey into software development is not the traditional route, for a matter of fact, I am a college dropout. Throughout my journey, there has been times where I wanted to give up, but I refuse to let this experience be a "what if" moment in my life.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/how-we-work/" target="_blank">Thinkful</a>, I've gained outstanding technical and soft skills that has helped me build an unshakeable foundation</p>
        <br>
        <p>Outside of developing, I enjoy playing basketball and watching anime. And before you ask, LeBron is better than Jordan</p>
